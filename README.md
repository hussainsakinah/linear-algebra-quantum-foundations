# Linear Algebra: Foundations for Quantum Computing

This repository presents a rigorous and formally structured exposition of Linear Algebra, developed with emphasis on its role in Quantum Theory and Quantum Computing.

The material progresses from algebraic foundations to Hilbert spaces and the operator framework underlying quantum state representations.

## Acknowledgment

The conceptual foundations and intuitive understanding for much of this material were developed through the lecture series of **Rajan Chopra**. His pedagogical clarity in Linear Algebra and Quantum Mathematics has been instrumental in shaping the author’s learning pathway.

## Motivation

Linear Algebra forms the mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics. Quantum states, observables, and transformations are naturally expressed using Hilbert spaces and linear operators.

This repository builds that mathematical machinery from first principles.
