# Linear Algebra: Foundations for Quantum Computing

This repository presents a rigorous and formally structured exposition of Linear Algebra, developed with emphasis on its role in Quantum Theory and Quantum Computing.

The material progresses from algebraic and vector space foundations to inner product spaces, Hilbert spaces, and the mathematical formalism underlying quantum state representations.

## Scope

The repository covers:

* Algebraic structures and fields
* Complex vector spaces
* Linear transformations and matrix representations
* Inner product spaces and induced norms
* Orthogonality and projections
* Completeness and Hilbert spaces
* Infinite-dimensional vector spaces
* Bra–ket notation and dual spaces
* Tensor product constructions

## Mathematical Style

All documents are written in formal mathematical language using LaTeX, with clearly separated:

* Definitions
* Theorems
* Proofs
* Examples
* Remarks

## Motivation

Linear Algebra forms the mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics. State spaces, observables, and quantum transformations are naturally expressed in the language of Hilbert spaces and linear operators.

This repository aims to build that structure from first principles.

## Target Audience

* Research supervisors
* Graduate admissions committees
* Professors in Mathematics & Physics
* Quantum Computing researchers
